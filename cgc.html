          Introduction
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          Jurassic Park inspires the Cretaceous Gardens Controller(CGC) system/application. I am incredibly proud of
          this project. Out of all the school projects I needed to code, this took the MOST work. It was for a Software
          Development course at
          UNM. The class taught me a lot. Up to this point during my school career, I had made some pretty big projects,
          but these projects were pre-designed. I was building something based on a spec sheet. This project was very
          different. This
          course was all about building software from beginning to end, which included mostly design. We were given an
          overall idea, and we needed to design a solution and then implement the solution. This project required a
          group of five people to
          work together. This requirement added additional complexities to the project that I believe has been a
          necessary experience for me to grow. The idea was to build an entire system to control the Cretaceous Gardens.
        </p>
        <p class="title is-3 has-text-dark is-family-secondary">
          Design Documents
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          We began our journey building this program by writing a Technical Feasibility Study(TFS) document. In this
          document, we take given logistical constraints provided by our "investors." For example, some constraints
          were. The payment system is
          all automated, and the cars are all self-driving, and they will pick up customers and bring them to the T-Rex
          exhibit. We also identified our constraints. These include constraints like the surveillance cameras must have
          redundant uplinks.
          Every node in the system must have a normal and emergency mode that responds to different protocols, and all
          Alarms must be audible in every part of the island. There must be non-audible alarms as well. This document
          determines if the
          project is even technically feasible.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          The next document we built was the Requirements Definition Document (RDD). The purpose of this document was to
          define the requirements to create the CGC. We determined several objectives we wanted our system to have.
          These included safety,
          positive user experience, maintainability, and efficiency. We defined every hardware and interface we would
          need for the CGC. This includes a pay kiosk, car, and electric fence enclosure. We also defined the
          capabilities of the system.
          These include the emergency features, the safety features, and financial analytics.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          The next document we made was the Software Requirements Specification(SRS). This document starts to get into
          more details of what is needed from a lower level in the software. What are the functions of each individual
          smaller component?
          What data do these components receive, and what do they send? Here we are defining the methods and behaviors
          of these pieces. The last part of this document describes different use cases and scenarios.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          The last document we wrote was the Software Architecture Design(SAD. This document has class diagrams and the
          implementation plan. This is document breathes life into every component from a software perspective. It shows
          which components
          run on their own thread, what physical hardware pieces that component controls, and how each component
          communicates with each other and the root node, which is the CGC.
        </p>
        <p class="title is-3 has-text-dark is-family-secondary">
          Software Overview
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          The final piece is to build the actual software. We followed our documents exclusively. This helped guide us
          in a lot of our programming as we already spent a lot of time of these decisions. The application was HUGE. It
          was one of the
          biggest programs I have made. Since we did not have to build this for a real park, we simulated everything's
          behavior. The video above shows what the interface would look like on a monitor system that would be used by
          an employee to monitor
          the park.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          We can see at the bottom of a video the entrance to the park. There are pay station kiosks that a visitor
          would walk up to and buy a "token." This token acts as a ticket to the park, but it also has a GPS and a
          screen with instructions in
          case of an emergency. The purple dots are employees walking around with unique employee-only tokens. The green
          dots are visitors. We see them spawn from the pay kiosks as would happen with a newly purchased token.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          When the visitors are ready to see the main attraction, they will go to a loading zone where a self-driving
          car will pick them up and then drop them off at the T-Rex exhibit. We also see helicopter icons that are
          constantly patrolling the
          park for safety. The "View Health" will toggle the health that all nodes are reporting. The "View Finances"
          button will change the GUI to showcase the current finances of the park. The last buttons will toggle the
          emergency protocol. This
          allows us to simulate the park's behaviors in case there is an emergency triggered for any reason.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          This is the project. Please feel free to browse the GitHub repo if you would like to test out and run the
          application. I have also included the PDF to each document mentioned above. The links to all of these are
          directly under the video
          above.
